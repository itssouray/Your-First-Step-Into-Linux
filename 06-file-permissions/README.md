# Linux File Permissions Made Simple

## Understanding Permissions
Linux controls file access through permissions for three user types: 
- **Owner** (user who created the file)
- **Group** (members of the file's group) 
- **Others** (everyone else)

There are three basic permissions:
- **Read (r)** = view file contents (4)
- **Write (w)** = modify files (2) 
- **Execute (x)** = run programs/scripts (1)

## Viewing Permissions
Run `ls -l` to see permissions in the format:
`-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 2048 Mar 5 10:00 filename`
This shows:
- First `-rwx`: Owner can read/write/execute
- Next `r-x`: Group can read/execute
- Last `r--`: Others can only read

## Changing Permissions (chmod)

### Letter Method (u=user, g=group, o=others, a=all)
Examples:
`chmod u+x file`       # Add execute for owner
`chmod go-w file`      # Remove write from group+others  
`chmod a=rw file`      # Set read+write for everyone

### Number Method (Recommended)
Add permission values (r=4 + w=2 + x=1):
`chmod 755 file`       # Owner: rwx (7), Group: r-x (5), Others: r-x (5)
`chmod 644 file`       # Owner: rw- (6), Group: r-- (4), Others: r-- (4)
`chmod 600 file`       # Owner: rw- (6), No access for others (00)

## Changing Ownership
`chown user file`              # Change file owner
`chown user:group file`        # Change owner and group
`chown -R user:group folder/`  # Change recursively

## Special Permissions
`chmod u+s file`    # SetUID - runs as owner
`chmod g+s folder/` # SetGID - new files inherit group  
`chmod +t folder/`  # Sticky bit - only owners can delete

## Default Permissions (umask)
`umask 022`  # Default (results in 755 dirs, 644 files)
`umask 077`  # Restrictive (700 dirs, 600 files)

## Quick Tips
- Directories need execute (x) permission to be entered
- Scripts need execute (x) to run
- Use `sudo` when changing system files
- Practice in a test directory first!

## Conclusion 
Understanding file permissions is crucial for system security and effective file management. With chmod, chown, and chgrp, you can easily manage access to files and directories. Special permissions like SetUID, SetGID, and Sticky Bit provide additional control, while umask helps define the default permission structure for new files.
